##SDK Version : ESP8266_RTOS_SDK_V1.4.2_16_07_04
##Platform : ESP-LAUNCHER BAOARD

##Operation Steps:

1. Enter path:/home/esp8266/Share, clone ESP8266 RTOS SDK to lubuntu environment by command: 
       
		git clone https://github.com/espressif/ESP8266_RTOS_SDK.git 
	   
2. Enter SDK folder:/home/esp8266/Share/ESP8266_RTOS_SDK, Copy examples next to bin/ folder in the SDK folder. The SDK folder should have folders inside it like : bin, examples, third party...

3. If the SDK path is not updated in gen_misc.sh, right click the script and edit the path to bin folder and SDK folder. for the current SDK, the gen_mish.sh would have a path like:
       
		export SDK_PATH="/home/esp8266/Share/ESP8266_RTOS_SDK"
		export BIN_PATH="/home/esp8266/Share/ESP8266_RTOS_SDK/bin"
	   
4. Enter example folder, run ./gen_misc.sh, and follow below steps to fininsh the sample code compile:
	
		Option 1 will be automatically selected, 
		Option 2 > Enter 1. 
		Option 3 > Enter Default(Just Press enter)
		Option 4 > Enter Default(Just Press enter)
		Option 5 > Enter 5.
	   
5. "user1.2048.new.5.bin" should be found in "/home/esp8266/Share/ESP8266_RTOS_SDK/bin/upgrade", Flash the Binaries with ESP Flashing tool at the instructed Locations. Download bin files to ESP-LAUNCHER as below sittings.
		
		Download address of each bin files:
		blank.bin				            0x1FE000
		esp_init_data_default.bin			    0x1FC000
		boot_v1.5.bin					    0x00000
		user1.2048.new.5.bin			            0x01000
		
		Flash download tool settings:
		CrystalFreq: 26M
		SPI SPEED: 40MHz
		SPID MODE: QIO
		FLASH SIZE: 16Mbit-C11
		
##FOR VERIFY: 
UART0 print as below after boot up
